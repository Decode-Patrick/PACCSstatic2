    Durable solutions for IDPs
</h2>
<h5>
    Project leader: Mohamed Fadal
</h5>

<p class="paragraph">
    Somaliland's pastoralists have confronted an escalating series of climate-related challenges.
    In particular, consecutive draughts have resulted in land degradation and largescale loss of livestock.
    This has caused widespread displacement as large parts of the rural pastoral population have migrated closer to urban and peri-urban areas in search of assistance, thereby becoming drought-induced Internally Displaced People (IDPs).
    This project examines the challenges and possible solutions to these interconnected crises of loss of pastoral livelihoods and displacement.
    It explores some of the shortcomings of current humanitarian practices and offers insights into pathways for more sustainable solutions and support.

    Market-oriented adaptations of pastoralists in Somaliland
</h2>
<h5>
    Project leader: Abdi Osman Haji
</h5>

<p class="paragraph">
    This research aims to explore market-based climate change adaptations of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in the Togdheer Region of Somaliland.
    At the centre of the study stands the question of how markets and commercial networks can be manged in ways that help enhance pastoralists livelihoods (including by increasing resilience to climate shock).
    Along these lines, and focusing in particular on examples of fodder production and peri-urban commercial camel dairy firms the study explores ways in which diversification of commercial activities can support, not replace, livestock production.

    Rangeland management in Somaliland: Lessons learned from Aroori grazing reserve
</h2>
<h5>
    Project leader: Ahmed I. Awale
</h5>

<p class="paragraph">
    This research explores rangeland management practices in Somaliland.
    It examines shifts and patterns shaping rangeland management in Somaliland, and provides an in-depth analysis of the case of the Aroori grazing reserve.
    The main objectives of the research is to assess the impact of the Aroori grazing reserve in terms of its socio-economic advantages to pastoral herders and livestock exporters, as well as its overall ecological benefits.
    The intention is that findings of the study can inform frameworks for better managing areas designated for pastoralist use, protecting communities from the adverse effects of climate change-induced droughts, including grazing deficiencies.

    Mapping climate governance in Somaliland and ways forward for pastoral climate resilience
</h2>
<h5>
    Project leader: Sharmaarke Musse
</h5>

<p class="paragraph">
    There is a significant gap in systematic analysis of climate change policy in Somaliland, including identification of areas for improvement.
    The research seeks to start addressing this gap.
    It does so by mapping the existing policy frameworks related to climate change in Somaliland, highlighting areas requiring further policy development and analyzing key barriers to effective implementation.
    Based on this mapping, the study also aims to propose ways forward for bridging global climate action consensus with localized approaches.
    In particular, it explores pathways for participatory climate governance, particularly in the pastoral sector, emphasizing collaboration across national, regional, and local levels grounded in Somaliland's capacities and leveraging public-private partnerships.

        Inclusive and sustainable pastoral development in Somaliland in the context of climate change: Market based and economic pathways (PhD project)    </h2>
    <h5>
        PhD. Candidate: Roble Abdi Muse
    </h5>
    
    <p class="paragraph">
        This PhD. project explores market-based and economic pathways for fostering inclusive and sustainable pastoral development in Somaliland in the context and the challenges posed by climate change.
        Despite pastoralists significant contributions to local, national and regional economies, they remain marginalized – or in unfavorably positioned – in regard to market access and commercial networks, which significantly disadvantages them.
        The project takes as its point of departure that markets and commercial networks are of growing importance for pastoralism, but that more attention needs to be given to market initiatives, policies and mechanisms that explicitly supports and includes pastoralists.

    <p class="paragraph">
        Pastoralism is the dominant livelihood for millions of East Africans, severely affected by climate change (drought, flash floods, weather variability). It is also a crucial locus of climate resilience, as pastoral systems have always adapted to challenging environmental conditions. However, pastoralism’s inherent resilience potentials have received limited academic attention and policy engagement.
