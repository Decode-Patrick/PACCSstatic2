on climate action calls for global outcomes.
However, most implementation will be local. And experiences of climate change impacts are place specific.
A ‘local lens’ focusing on indicators for local action and adaptation is therefore crucial for informing global approaches to addressing climate change.

<p class="paragraph">
The research programme Pastoralist Climate Change Resilience in Somaliland (PACCS) (2022-2027) will generate cutting-edge theoretical and policy knowledge on local climate change resilience in Somaliland, focusing on the critical but overlooked livelihood system of pastoralism. It takes a cross-sectoral approach, and accounts for pastoralist climate resilience strategies across the domains of markets, land management and governance.

<p class="paragraph">
    Pastoralism is the dominant livelihood for millions of East Africans, severely affected by climate change (drought, flash floods, weather variability). It is also a crucial locus of climate resilience, as pastoral systems have always adapted to challenging environmental conditions. However, pastoralism’s inherent resilience potentials have received limited academic attention and policy engagement.
