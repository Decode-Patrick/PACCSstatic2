However, most implementation will be local. And experiences of climate change impacts are place specific. Partnerships

and a ‘local lens’ focusing on indicators for local action, adaptation and capacity is therefore crucial for informing global approaches to addressing climate change.

Capacity building activities in Somaliland are a key pillar of PACCS.
They centre on strengthening research, data management and training capacities of SORADI and UoH, research–based education, and research collaboration (local, regional and North-South).

<p>
PACCS capacity building activities have synergies with and contribute to the Danida-funded program Building Stronger Universities IV <a href="https://forskning.ruc.dk/en/projects/building-stronger-universities-iv-2" target="_blank">Building Stronger Universities, IV — Roskilde University Research Portal (ruc.dk)</a>, and currently focuses on creating a Master Program on climate change and environmental science.

<p class="paragraph">
The research programme Pastoralist Climate Change Resilience in Somaliland (PACCS) (2022-2027) will generate cutting-edge theoretical and policy knowledge on local climate change resilience in Somaliland, focusing on the critical but overlooked livelihood system of pastoralism. It takes a cross-sectoral approach, and accounts for pastoralist climate resilience strategies across the domains of markets, land management and governance.

<p class="paragraph">
    Pastoralism is the dominant livelihood for millions of East Africans, severely affected by climate change (drought, flash floods, weather variability). It is also a crucial locus of climate resilience, as pastoral systems have always adapted to challenging environmental conditions. However, pastoralism’s inherent resilience potentials have received limited academic attention and policy engagement.
