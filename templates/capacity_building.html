Sustainable Development Goal 13
<a href="https://www.globalgoals.org/goals/13-climate-action" target="_blank">(SDG Goal 13)</a>
on climate action calls for global outcomes.
However, most implementation will be local. And experiences of climate change impacts are place specific. Partnerships

<a href="https://www.globalgoals.org/goals/17-partnerships-for-the-goals/" target="_blank">(SDG Goal 17)</a>

and a ‘local lens’ focusing on indicators for local action, adaptation and capacity is therefore crucial for informing global approaches to addressing climate change.

<p class="paragraph">
Capacity building activities in Somaliland are a key pillar of PACCS.
They centre on strengthening research, data management and training capacities of SORADI and UoH, research–based education, and research collaboration (local, regional and North-South).  
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
PACCS capacity building activities have synergies with and contribute to the Danida-funded program Building Stronger Universities IV <a href="https://forskning.ruc.dk/en/projects/building-stronger-universities-iv-2" target="_blank">Building Stronger Universities, IV — Roskilde University Research Portal (ruc.dk)</a>, and currently focuses on creating a Master Program on climate change and environmental science.
