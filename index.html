    <p class="paragraph">
        Pastoralism is a dominant livelihood for Somalilanders, and more widely for millions of East Africans, yet severely affected by climate change (drought, flash floods, weather variability).
        It is also a crucial locus of climate resilience, as pastoral systems have always adapted to challenging environmental conditions.
        However, pastoralismâ€™s inherent resilience potentials, as well as its specific needs for supportive governance systems, have received limited academic attention and policy engagement.
